# Predicting Titanic Survival using Machine Learning ðŸš¢  

Those who don't know what kaggle is! Kaggle is like a huge  Machine Learning Engineers and Data Science Community. From providing data-sets to machine-learning competitions kaggle does it all. Do check it out https://www.kaggle.com/ <br>
Kaggle titanic competition is a introductory machine-learning competition for beginners. Anyone trying machine learning for first time ,**Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** is a must go https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic .<br>
**This Notebook looks into various Python-based Machine learning and Data Science libraries in an attempt to build a Machine learning models which predicts whether the passenger will survive or not based on the data attributes provided from Kaggle.**
