# Predicting Titanic Survival using Machine Learning ðŸš¢  

Those who don't know what kaggle is! Kaggle is like a huge  Machine Learning Engineers and Data Science Community. From providing data-sets to machine-learning competitions kaggle does it all. Do check it out https://www.kaggle.com/
This Notebook looks into various Python-based Machine learning and Data Science libraries in an attempt <font color='red'>to build a Machine learning models which predicts whether the passenger will survive or not based on the data attributes provided from Kaggle.</font>
